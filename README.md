## Task 3: Collatz.py - Controlling the flow
This task asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation.
At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one.
The program will end if the current value is one.
## Task prompt
$ python collatz.py
Please enter a positive integer: 10
10 5 16 8 4 2 1

## Task 4: Weekday.py - Data
This task is to write a program that outputs whether or not today is a weekday. If it is a weekday the program should output "Yes, unfortunately today is a weekday.". If it is a weekend day the program should output "It is the weekend, yay!".

## Task prompt
An example of running this program on a Thursday is given below.
$ python weekday.py
Yes, unfortunately today is a weekday.
An example of running it on a Saturday is as follows:
$ python weekday.py
