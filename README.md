# This is the summary of the weekly tasks submission as part of this module

## Task 1: bank.py - Statements 
This program is called 'bank.py'. It prompts the user and reads in two money amounts (in cent). It adds the two amounts. It prints out the answer in a human readable format with a euro sign and decimal point between the euro and cent of the amount. e.g. €2.45.
## Task prompt
* $ python bank.py
* Enter amount1(in cent): 65
* Enter amount2(in cent): 180
* The sum of these is €2.45

## Task 3: Collatz.py - Controlling the flow
This task asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation.
At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one.
The program will end if the current value is one.

## Task prompt
* $ python collatz.py
* Please enter a positive integer: 10
* 10 5 16 8 4 2 1
